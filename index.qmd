Hi, 

I'm a dreamer, fighter, and explorer who is not afraid to step out of my comfort zone and venture into any unknown territory. My name is Clinta Puthussery Varghese and I am currently pursuing my second semester as a graduate student in Statistics at [Zicklin School of Business](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/) in the [Baruch College](https://baruch.cuny.edu/), [City University Of New York](https://www.cuny.edu/) with an anticipated graduation in May 2026.\

My aspiration is to become a Data Scientist. As beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, so too does the power of data rest in the hands of the analyst. I am dedicated to equipping myself to work with messy data, uncover insights, and ultimately contribute to making the world a better place.

I am currently interning at Weill Cornell Medicine in the Computational Biology Lab under [Dr. Annalise Schweickart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annalise-schweickart-904896b3/). Additionally, I serve as a Graduate Tutor, supporting courses such as [STA 9708](https://baruch-graduate.catalog.cuny.edu/courses/0947211), [CIS 9650], and [CIS 9340]. I also hold a Graduate Teaching Assistant role under [Professor Yu Yue](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/faculty-profile/yu-ryan-yue/) in the Paul H. Chook Department of Information Systems and Statistics.

In my free time, I enjoy crafting, especially diamond art painting, and traveling to explore new places.
