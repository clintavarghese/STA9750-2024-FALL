Welcome!
Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Clinta Puthussery Varghese.

Iâ€™m a dreamer, fighter and an explorer who is not afraid to step out of my comfort zone and venture into any unknown territory. 

My name is Clinta Puthussery Varghese and I am currently pursuing my second semester as a graduate student in Statistics at [Zicklin School of Business](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/) in the Baruch College, City University Of New York with an anticipated graduation in May 2026.

My aspiration is to become a Data Scientist. As beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, so too does the power of data rest in the hands of the analyst. I am dedicated to equipping myself to work with messy data, uncover insights, and ultimately contribute to making the world a better place.

My Projects in R:

1.[**Descriptive Statistical Analysis:**](https://clintavarghese.github.io/STA9750-2024-FALL/mp01.html) Fiscal Characteristics of Major US Public Transit Systems\
2.[**Data-Based Support for Sales Pitch:**](https://clintavarghese.github.io/STA9750-2024-FALL/mp02.html) Exploratory Data Analysis and Movie Analysis\
3.[**Data-Based Evaluation of Third-Party Assertion:**](https://clintavarghese.github.io/STA9750-2024-FALL/mp03.html) Do Proportional Electoral College Allocations Yield a More Representative Presidency?\
4.[**Data-Driven Decision Support:** ]((https://clintavarghese.github.io/STA9750-2024-FALL/mp04.html))
