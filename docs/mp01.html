<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h4>
<p>This project is inspired from popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityNerd">CityNerd</a> Youtube channel’s presentation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl7cprP_6KM"><em>Farebox Recovery</em></a>. The main goal of this mini project is to explore, analyze, and interpret transit data from various sources to derive insights into ridership trends, agency performance, and the financial efficiency of transit systems for the year 2022.</p>
<p>The primary source of data is from <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a></p>
<p>The datasets used in this analysis is from</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Annual Database Fare Revenues</a> table</p></li>
<li><p>The latest <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> tables</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a> reports</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis primarily focuses on key financial and operational performance metrics, such as Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM), Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT), and Farebox Recovery Ratio (the ratio of total fares to expenses). Additional explorations focus on the most efficient transit modes and the busiest metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>We imported three main datasets: Fare Revenue (<code>FARES</code>), Operating Expenses (<code>EXPENSES</code>), and Ridership Data (<code>TRIPS</code>, <code>MILES</code>). These were cleaned and filtered to remove irrelevant columns, resulting in a dataset that focuses on total fares, expenses, and VRM/UPT data.</p>

<p>After importing the data, several unnecessary columns were dropped to keep the datasets focused on the required metrics (UPT, VRM, Expenses, etc.)</p>
<p>To extract monthly financials such as Total Fares and Expenses for each mode, A new dataset (<code>FINANCIALS</code>) is created by joining Fare Revenue (<code>FARES</code>), Operating Expenses (<code>EXPENSES</code>). It contains (<code>NTD ID</code>, <code>Agency Name</code> , <code>Mode</code>, <code>Total Fares</code>, <code>Expenses</code>)</p>

<p>Similarly to extract monthly transits numbers such as Unlinked Passenger Trip and Vehicle Revenue Miles for each agency and mode, a new data set USAGE(<code>USAGE</code>) is created by joining TRIPS (<code>TRIPS</code>) and MILES (<code>MILES</code>).

<p>There are 38 agencies operating in the NY–Jersey City–Newark, NY–NJ metro area and 22 agencies in the Los Angeles–Long Beach, CA region. Let’s focus on the NY–NJ area and explore which agency and mode of transit achieved the highest Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) per trip each year.</p>
<p>The VRM per trip ratio provides valuable insights into agency efficiency. A lower ratio indicates higher vehicle utilization, meaning the agency is transporting more passengers per mile of service. Typically, urban areas tend to have lower VRM per trip ratios compared to rural areas.</p>
<p>To assess the efficiency of agencies in the NY–NJ metropolitan area, we calculated the ratio of VRM to Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT). This ratio reflects how well transit systems are utilizing their vehicles in relation to passenger demand, with a lower VRM/UPT ratio indicating better efficiency.</p>
