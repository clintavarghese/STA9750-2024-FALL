    "text": "Mini Project #1: Analyzing Transit Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI. Introduction\nThis project is inspired from popular CityNerd Youtube channel’s presentation on Farebox Recovery. The main goal of this mini project is to explore, analyze, and interpret transit data from various sources to derive insights into ridership trends, agency performance, and the financial efficiency of transit systems for the year 2022.\nThe primary source of data is from National Transit Database\nThe datasets used in this analysis is from\n\nThe 2022 Annual Database Fare Revenues table\nThe latest Monthly Ridership tables\nThe 2022 Operating Expenses reports\n\nThe analysis primarily focuses on key financial and operational performance metrics, such as Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM), Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT), and Farebox Recovery Ratio (the ratio of total fares to expenses). Additional explorations focus on the most efficient transit modes and the busiest metropolitan areas.\n\n\nII. Data Preparation\n\nLoading Required Libraries\nTo begin, we load the necessary R libraries, primarily using the tidyverse package for data wrangling and DT for data visualization.\n\nif (!require(\"tidyverse\")) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nif (!require(\"DT\")) install.packages(\"DT\")\n\nLoading required package: DT\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(DT)\n\n\n\nImporting Datasets\nWe imported three main datasets: Fare Revenue (FARES), Operating Expenses (EXPENSES), and Ridership Data (TRIPS, MILES).

(total number of miles traveled by a vehicle while it is in service and generating revenue by transporting passengers. It is used in public transportation and transit systems to measure the productive service a vehicle provides.)\nVehicle revenue miles include: Layover / recovery time\nVehicle revenue miles exclude: Deadhead, Operator training,Vehicle maintenance testing, and Other non-revenue uses of vehicles.\n\n1.Which transit agency had the most total VRM?\n\n\n\n\nBy summarizing VRM across transit agencies from 2002 to 2024, (I created a function named table_creation to tables)\n\n\n\ntable_creation(\n  USAGE %&gt;%\n    group_by(Agency) %&gt;%\n    summarise(total_VRM = sum(VRM)) %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(total_VRM)) %&gt;%\n    slice(1:3))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transit agency with the highest VRM in the sample is identified as\nAgency: MTA New York City Transit with Total_VRM: 10.83 billion.\n\n2.Which transit mode had the most total VRM?\nSimilarly, the analysis was performed by transit mode and arranged in descending order.\n\n\ntable_creation(USAGE %&gt;%\n  group_by(Mode) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_VRM = sum(VRM)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_VRM)) |&gt; slice(1:3))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transist Mode (Motor Bus) had the total VRM of (49.45 billion)\n\n3.NYC Subway Ridership in May 2024\nTo analyze ridership on the NYC Subway, we filtered the data for Heavy Rail in May 2024 and retrieved UPT values:\n\n\ntable_creation(USAGE %&gt;%\n  filter(Mode == 'Heavy Rail' & str_detect(Agency, \"New York City\") & month == \"2024-05-01\") %&gt;%\n  select(Mode,UPT))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe monthly ridership of subway for month of May 2025 is total UPT of (180.46 million)\n\n\n4.NYC Subway Ridership Decline from April 2019 to April 2020\nA significant decline in ridership was observed between April 2019 and April 2020. The percentage decline was calculated, and the ridership trend was plotted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe subway system experienced a 91.28% decline in ridership between April 2019 and April 2020.\n\nQuestions that I explore by myself\n\n#1. Which are the top 5 metropolitan areas with the highest number of transit agencies?\n\n\ntable_creation(USAGE |&gt;group_by(metro_area)|&gt;\nsummarize(`number of agencies` =length(unique(Agency)))|&gt;\narrange(desc(`number of agencies`)) |&gt;\nslice(1:5))\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 38 agencies operating in the NY–Jersey City–Newark, NY–NJ metro area and 22 agencies in the Los Angeles–Long Beach, CA region. Let’s focus on the NY–NJ area.\n\n#2 What type of Transist Modes are Offered by Agencies in NY-NJ Metro Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost agencies in NY-NJ Metro area offers Bus services. Lets see how is the presence of each mode with in Agencies.\n\n\nWarning: The `size` argument of `element_line()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s surprising to see that the Vanpool service is exclusively offered by NJT. Given the vastness of the NY-NJ metropolitan area, it would be beneficial to promote Vanpool services similar to how other major cities like the SF-LA area are doing.\n\n#3 Which Mode of transit achieved the highest Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) per trip each year.\n\nThe VRM per trip ratio provides valuable insights into agency efficiency. A lower ratio indicates higher vehicle utilization, meaning the agency is transporting more passengers per mile of service. Typically, urban areas tend to have lower VRM per trip ratios compared to rural areas.\nTo assess the efficiency of agencies in the NY–NJ metropolitan area, we calculated the ratio of VRM to Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT). This ratio reflects how well transit systems are utilizing their vehicles in relation to passenger demand, with a lower VRM/UPT ratio indicating better efficiency.\n\n#Which Transist Mode is profitable in termns of VRM/UPT Ratio:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable_creation(\n  NY_NJ|&gt;filter(year&gt;=2021,year&lt;=2024)|&gt;\n    group_by(Agency,Mode)|&gt;\n    summarize(median_ratio=round(median(ratio,na.rm=TRUE),2), )|&gt;\n                arrange(median_ratio))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Agency'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(\"Table for mean of median VRM/UPT ratios for each mode in NY-NJ Metro Area from 2021 to 2024\")\n\n[1] \"Table for mean of median VRM/UPT ratios for each mode in NY-NJ Metro Area from 2021 to 2024\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFerryboat service and heavy rail service has the lowest VRM/UPT ratio after factoring no-agencies contributing to the data, This means those modes have better operational efficiency in terms of ridership relative to miles driven.\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIV Financial and Usage Data Analysis\n\nCombining USAGE and FINANCIALS\nAnalysing some data about financial recovery\nThe USAGE and FINANCIALS datasets were combined, and as a threshold total UPT &gt; 400000 is been taken into consideration.\n\nUSAGE_2022_ANNUAL&lt;- USAGE |&gt; filter(year==\"2022\")|&gt;\n  group_by(`NTD ID`,\nAgency,\nmetro_area,\nMode)|&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_UPT=sum(UPT,na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_VRM=sum(VRM,na.rm = TRUE)\n  )|&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'NTD ID', 'Agency', 'metro_area'.

Transit System with the Highest Farebox Recovery For The Year 2022\n\nFarebox recovery is the ratio of Total Fares to Total Expenses, measuring how effectively fare revenue covers a transit system’s operational costs. It’s crucial for a transit agency to generate enough revenue from passengers to offset its operating expenses. A higher farebox recovery ratio reduces the agency’s reliance on alternative funding sources to keep the transit system running.\n\ntable_creation(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS_top |&gt; \n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    fare_box_ratio = round(ifelse(`Total Fares` &gt; 0, `Total Fares`, NA_real_) / ifelse(Expenses &gt; 0, Expenses, NA_real_),2\n  )) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(fare_box_ratio)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  slice(1:5))\n\nWarning: Returning more (or less) than 1 row per `summarise()` group was deprecated in\ndplyr 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `reframe()` instead.\nℹ When switching from `summarise()` to `reframe()`, remember that `reframe()`\n  always returns an ungrouped data frame and adjust accordingly.\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Agency', 'Mode'. You can override using\nthe `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency: Port Imperial Ferry Corporation\nMode: Ferry Boat\nFarebox Recovery Ratio: 1.43\nInteresting Facts about Port Imperial Ferry’s Role\nIn 2022, the system with the highest farebox recovery ratio was the Port Imperial Ferry Corporation.\n\n\nPrime Location: Port Imperial terminal, located in Weehawken, New Jersey, connects commuters from New Jersey’s Hudson River waterfront to key locations in Manhattan. It is a crucial transportation link, especially for daily commuters.\n\nIntermodal Hub: It is also part of an intermodal hub, with connections to New Jersey Transit’s Hudson-Bergen Light Rail. This makes it easier for commuters to switch transit modes, enhancing the system’s convenience.\n\nTime-Saving Option: Their primary customers are daily commuters as it is often faster than other transit modes during rush hours, avoiding heavy traffic on bridges and tunnels, making it a preferred option for those seeking efficiency.\n\nSummary: Port Imperial Ferry’s high farebox recovery is driven by its limited competition, strategic docking agreements, loyal commuter base, and efficient cost management, allowing the service to generate significant revenue relative to its operational costs.\n\n\n\n2. Transit System with the Lowest Expenses per Unlinked Passenger Trip (UPT)\n\nExpenses per UPT measure the cost efficiency of a transit system, indicating how much the agency spends to serve per unlinked passenger trip.\n\ntable_creation(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS_top |&gt; \n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    expenses_per_UPT = round(ifelse(Expenses &gt; 0, Expenses, NA_real_) / total_UPT\n  ,2)) |&gt; \n  arrange(expenses_per_UPT) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  slice(1:5))\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency: North Carolina State University\nMode: Motor Bus\nExpenses per UPT: 1.18 $/ride\n\n\nWhy NCSU’s Motorbus System is Profitable?\n\nCampus Size: North Carolina State University’s main campus spans over 2,000 acres. This vast area creates the need for an internal transportation network to efficiently connect different parts of the university.\nTransportation Master Plan: NCSU has a well-structured Transportation Master Plan aimed at improving and optimizing its transportation network. This plan includes strategies to enhance route efficiency, reduce congestion, and ensure the system meets the growing demands of the campus population.\nInstitutional Support and Subsidies: NCSU likely subsidizes a portion of the motor bus system’s operating costs, which helps keep operational expenses lower. University funding or student fees may cover some costs, reducing the financial burden on passengers while keeping fares affordable, if not free.\nHigh Ridership: With a high volume of students and staff commuting daily, the system benefits from economies of scale. High passenger volume distributes operational costs across more riders, making the cost per trip lower, and ensuring the bus system operates efficiently.\nFocused Cost Management: NCSU’s internal control over the transportation system allows for focused cost management. With optimized vehicle maintenance, route planning, and operational schedules, the motor bus system is kept cost-efficient, ensuring its financial sustainability.\nSummary: NCSU’s motor bus system is profitable due to the combination of a large and spread-out campus, optimized and efficient route planning, institutional subsidies, and high ridership levels. This strategic approach, combined with NCSU’s Transportation Master Plan, ensures that the system operates at a low cost, making it not only cost-efficient but also potentially profitable.\n\n\n3. Transit System with the Highest Total Fares per UPT\n\nThe highest total fares per UPT indicate the system that generates the most fare revenue per passenger trip.\n\ntable_creation(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS_top |&gt; \n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    totalfares_per_UPT = round(ifelse(`Total Fares` &gt; 0, `Total Fares`, NA_real_) / total_UPT\n  ,2)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(totalfares_per_UPT)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  slice(1:5))\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency: Hampton Jitney, Inc\nMode: Commuter Bus\nFares per UPT: 41.3 $/mile\nHampton Jitney is a commuter bus company.  Their Three primary routes from the east end of Long Island (The Hamptons and the North Fork) to New York City. Hampton Jitney also operates charter and tour services, along with local transit bus service in eastern Suffolk County under contract with Suffolk County Transit.\n\n\n\nWhy Hampton Jitney, Inc. has the highest fare per UPT?\n\nWealthy Customer Base : The Hampton Jitney serves affluent passengers traveling between New York City and the Hamptons, a popular destination for wealthy individuals. These passengers are generally less sensitive to price and are willing to pay premium fares for a convenient, comfortable ride.\n\nPrivate Agency : As a private transportation service, Hampton Jitney is not bound by government fare controls or subsidies. This allows the agency to charge market-based fares that reflect the demand and exclusive nature of the service.\n\nPremium Service : The Hampton Jitney offers luxury features such as comfortable seating, Wi-Fi, and direct routes, which justify the higher fare prices. Customers are paying not just for transportation, but for an upscale, stress-free experience.\nConvenient and Direct Routes: The bus service offers direct transportation from Manhattan to the Hamptons, saving passengers the hassle of driving or taking multiple transfers on public transportation. This convenience is a major factor in the willingness of passengers to pay higher fares.\nSeasonal Demand: The Hamptons is a popular summer destination, and during peak seasons, demand for transportation to and from the area skyrockets. Hampton Jitney can charge premium fares during these high-demand periods, further increasing their fare per UPT.\n\nConclusion: Hampton Jitney’s high fare per ride is driven by its affluent customer base, premium service offerings, convenient routes, and its ability to charge market-driven prices as a private agency. The high fare reflects the value that customers place on convenience and comfort, particularly when traveling to a luxury destination like the Hamptons.\n\n\n\n4. Transit System with the Lowest Expenses per Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM)\n\nThis metric shows the agency that operates most efficiently in terms of expenses for each mile their vehicles are in service.\n\ntable_creation(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS_top |&gt; \n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    expenses_per_VRM = round(ifelse(Expenses &gt; 0, Expenses, NA_real_) / ifelse(total_VRM &gt; 0, total_VRM, NA_real_),2)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(expenses_per_VRM) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  slice(1:5))\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency: Metropolitan Transportation Commission\nMode: Vanpool\nExpenses per VRM: 0.445 $/mile\n**Metro-Area*:** San Francisco--Oakland, CA\nThe Bay Area Vanpool Program, managed by the MTC, supports groups of 7 to 15 commuters traveling together with an unpaid driver.\n\nAccording to the Berkleyside, Casual Carpool was a Bay Area tradition before COVID. Post Covid, longtime riders and drivers who want to revive casual carpool are finding it difficult to reestablish the famously organic tradition. But since many people are returning to work and seeking efficient ways to travel, and it’s interesting to observe that there’s a slow resurgence of this informal carpooling tradition.\n\n\nWhy MTC’S Vanpool reduce expenses per Vehicle Revenue Mile (VRM)?\n\nCost-Effective Commute : Vanpooling is often more economical than driving alone, with participants sharing the costs of fuel, tolls, and maintenance. This can lead to significant savings for commuters.\n\nSustainable Way : By reducing the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road, vanpools help decrease traffic congestion and lower greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a more sustainable environment.\n\nVanpool Rewards : The MTC actively promotes vanpooling as part of its broader strategy to enhance public transportation options and reduce reliance on individual car travel. Each counties provides different benefits including pre-tax benefits, discounted parking permits and subsidies for commuter vanpoolers\n\n\n\n5. Transit System with the Highest Total Fares per VRM\n\n\nThe highest total fares per VRM represent the system that generates the most fare revenue for each mile that its vehicles are in service.\n\n\ntable_creation(USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS_top |&gt; \n  group_by(Agency, Mode) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    fares_per_VRM = round(ifelse(`Total Fares` &gt; 0, `Total Fares`, NA_real_) / ifelse(total_VRM &gt; 0, total_VRM, NA_real_),2)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(fares_per_VRM)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  slice(1:5))\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency: Jacksonville Transportation Authority\nMode: Ferryboat\nFares per VRM: 157.70 $/mile\nThe St. Johns River Ferry is an important transportation link, providing service across the St. Johns River and facilitating commuter travel.\n\n\nWhat do you believe to be the most efficient transit system in the country?\nIn my view, the most efficient transit system is one that prioritizes the needs of the community rather than focusing solely on generating revenue. Such a system aims to provide reliable and accessible transportation options that serve the public effectively. Among the various transit modes analyzed, I find ferryboats to be particularly efficient, especially in terms of their overall Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) to Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) ratio. This efficiency indicates that ferryboats are capable of serving a substantial number of passengers relative to the distance traveled, making them a viable option for enhancing urban mobility.\nAdditionally, when considering cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability, the Vanpool mode emerges as the best option. Vanpools not only reduce operational costs but also contribute positively to the environment by minimizing the number of individual vehicles on the road. By consolidating passengers into fewer vehicles, Vanpools can significantly decrease carbon emissions and traffic congestion, promoting a greener transit solution.\nUltimately, an efficient transit system should not merely aim for financial gain but should instead focus on fulfilling the transportation needs of its users while fostering sustainable practices. By investing in transit options like ferryboats and Vanpools, cities can create a more effective and environmentally friendly transportation network that benefits both the community and the planet.\n\n\nAppendix\nAdditional data and visualizations can be provided upon request, including full code listings and intermediate data tables."
